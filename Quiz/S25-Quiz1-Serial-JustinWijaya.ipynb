    "> You will be given **until the end of class** to complete this quiz.  Use your time wisely. \n",

    "> **HINTS:**\n",
    "> - Neatness and grammar is important.  We will ignore all notes or code we can not read or understand.\n",
    "> - Read the entire quiz from beginning to end before starting.  Not all questions are equal in **points vs. time** so plan your time accordingly. \n",
    "> - Spaces for answers are provided. Delete the prompting text such as \"Put your answer to the above question here\" and replace it with your answer. Do not leave the prompting text with your answer.\n",
    "> - Do not assume that the answer must be in the same format of the cell provided. Feel free to change the cell formatting (e.g., markdown to code, and vice versa) or add additional cells as needed to provide your answer.\n",
    "> - When a question asks for an answer \"**in your own words**\" it is still okay to search the Internet for the answer as a reminder. *However*, we would like you to do more than copy and paste.  Make the answer your own. \n",
    "> - If you get stuck, try not to leave an answer blank. It is better to include some notes or stub functions so we have an idea about your thinking process so we can give you partial credit.   \n",
